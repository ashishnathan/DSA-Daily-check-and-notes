Day 1

Data Structures - organization of data to access it efficiently.

algorithm - a step-by-step set of operations to solve a specific problem or a set of problems

Types of data structures - 
- Linear (stack, array, linked list)
- non-linear (tree, graph)
- Static (compile time memory allocation) for faster access, but slow insertion and deletion
- dynamic (runtime memory allocation) for faster insertion/deletion but slow access to elements

Searching algorithms
- finding an element in a list
- also depends on the time and space complexity of the problem
